# WordPress Test Project for AbeloHost: Cities, Countries, and Temperature Widget

This is a WordPress project that displays a table of countries, cities, and their current temperatures using custom post types and taxonomies. It fetches the temperature data from the `api.open-meteo.com` API instead of OpenWeatherMap.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

- A WordPress installation set up.
- Access to the WordPress theme directory for your child theme.

Additionally, you can choose to set up the project using **Docker** for a local development environment.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository or Copy the Files

- Clone or copy the project files into your directory.

### 2. Install WordPress

If you haven't already installed WordPress, you can follow the official instructions to do so: https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/

Alternatively, if you prefer to set up the project using **Docker**, follow the Docker setup instructions below.

### Docker Setup (Optional)

If you'd like to run the WordPress project in a local environment using **Docker**, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker**:
   - Follow the installation guide for Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

2. **Clone the Docker WordPress Project**:
   - Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file is in your project directory.

3. **Start the Containers**:
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Access WordPress**:
   - Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to complete the WordPress setup.

---

### 3. Enable the Child Theme

- In your WordPress admin dashboard, go to **Appearance > Themes** and activate the `storefront-child` theme.

### 4. Custom Post Type & Taxonomy

The theme includes a custom post type for "Cities" and a custom taxonomy for "Countries". These are registered using the following functions:

- `create_cities_post_type()`
- `create_countries_taxonomy()`

This allows you to add cities as posts and categorize them under different countries.

### 5. Add City Meta Data

Each city post will have latitude and longitude metadata. You can add the coordinates through the post editor, using the **City Coordinates** meta box. The latitude and longitude values are used to fetch the current temperature from the API.

### 6. Temperature Widget

A custom widget `City_Temperature_Widget` is included to display the temperature based on the city's coordinates. This widget can be added to any widget area within your WordPress site.

### 7. AJAX Search for Cities

A live search feature allows users to search for cities by name. As users type a city name, the table of cities will update dynamically using AJAX.

### 8. API Integration

This project uses the `api.open-meteo.com` API to fetch current weather data, specifically the temperature, for the cities based on their latitude and longitude. This API is used instead of the OpenWeatherMap API.

Hereâ€™s how we fetch the temperature:

```php
$response = wp_remote_get("https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=$latitude&longitude=$longitude&current_weather=true");
